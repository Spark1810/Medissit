## Folder and File Descriptions

### 1. `Dementia_Prediction_System/`
This folder contains files and code relevant to the Alzheimer’s detection system. It may include:
   - **Data**: Datasets used for model training and testing.
   - **Models**: Machine learning or deep learning models trained to predict dementia risk based on input parameters.
   - **Scripts**: Python or Jupyter notebook files for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment.

### 2. `Features/`
This folder is likely dedicated to additional features or enhancements related to the project. It might include:
   - **Code snippets**: Supporting scripts or helper functions that extend the main project.
   - **Documentation**: Any descriptive documents detailing the extra functionalities added to the project.

### 3. `RAG Chatbot/`
This folder holds files for the RAG (Retrieve and Generate) chatbot, a conversational AI that may provide relevant information or assist users in interacting with the Alzheimer detection system. Contents could include:
   - **Chatbot model files**: Trained models and configuration files specific to the chatbot.
   - **Scripts**: Code to set up and deploy the chatbot.
   - **Dialogues**: Sample conversations or predefined responses used by the chatbot to assist in queries related to dementia and Alzheimer’s.

### 4. `AR Interface/`
This folder contains files for the Augmented Reality (AR) interface. It may be intended to provide users with an interactive and immersive way to understand Alzheimer’s disease data or interact with the prediction system. Contents might include:
   - **AR Models**: 3D models or assets used in the AR environment.
   - **Scripts**: Code for rendering AR content or integrating with the Alzheimer detection application.
   - **Setup Files**: Files necessary for setting up and launching the AR interface on supported devices.

### 5. `IDEA PRESENTATION` (PowerPoint)
This PowerPoint file contains a presentation that likely explains the core idea and objectives of the project. It may include:
   - **Project Background**: An introduction to Alzheimer’s disease and its impact.
   - **Problem Statement**: Explanation of the problem the project aims to solve.
   - **Solution Overview**: High-level overview of the proposed Alzheimer detection and assistance system.
   - **Implementation Details**: Insights into the technical aspects, including data processing, model development, and any user interface components.
   - **Future Directions**: Potential improvements and areas for future work.

### 6. `README`
This README file provides an overview of the project and explains the purpose of each folder and file.

### 7. `Sample Pics/`
This folder contains sample images, which may be used for testing, documentation, or illustration within the app or presentations. These images could include:
   - **Screenshots**: Images showing the app interface or predictions.
   - **Visualizations**: Graphs or charts that display Alzheimer’s data statistics.
   - **AR Samples**: Example views of how the AR interface might look on supported devices.

## Getting Started

To begin using this project:
1. Refer to the `RAG Chatbot` folder to explore the chatbot and its functionality.
2. Review the `Dementia_Prediction_System` folder for code related to Alzheimer detection.
3. Check the `AR Interface` folder to understand the AR-based interactions.
4. Open the `IDEA PRESENTATION` PowerPoint to get a summary of the project’s objectives and design.
5. Look at `Sample Pics` to see visual aids that may enhance understanding or serve as examples.
